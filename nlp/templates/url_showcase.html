      <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning</h2>

      <p class="">Lately, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is a hot topic in the tech industry.
It is less than 2 mins, and simplifies Artificial intelligence & Machine learning.
According to Stanford Researcher, John McCarthy, “Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
Artificial Intelligence is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.”
AI is achieved by analysing how the human brain works while solving an issue and then using that analytical problem-solving techniques to build complex algorithms to perform similar tasks.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
This type of Machine Learning algorithms allows software agents and machines to automatically determine the ideal behaviour within a specific context, to maximise its performance.
Reinforcement learning is defined by characterising a learning problem and not by characterising learning methods.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning always interests and surprises us with their innovations.
There are certain implications of AI and ML to incorporate data analysis like Descriptive analytics, Prescriptive analytics and Predictive analytics, discussed in our next blog: How Machine Learning can boost your Predictive Analytics?</p>

      <h2>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) </h2>

      <p class="">   Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software.
To build and manage an enterprise-wide RPA program, you need technology that can go far beyond simply helping you automate a single process.
Your RPA technology must support you end-to-end, from discovering great automation opportunities everywhere, to quickly building high-performing robots, to managing thousands of automated workflows.
When you combine RPA’s quantifiable value with its ease of implementation relative to other enterprise technology, it’s easy to see why RPA adoption has been accelerating worldwide.
From a CFO’s perspective, an investment in RPA technology delivers rapid ROI and requires minimal upfront spending compared to other enterprise technology.
And because software robots can easily access and work within legacy systems, RPA has become a key enabler for digital transformation.
Employees find that it’s easy to adopt robotic assistants into their workdays, and that RPA’s low-code approach lets them become citizen developers who can build their own simple automations.
RPA is not AI; AI is not RPA.
For one thing, RPA technology now makes it possible to insert advanced AI skills in the form of machine learning models, natural language processing (NLP), character and image recognition, and more into RPA robots.
AI is also making it possible to scientifically discover a complete range of automation opportunities and build a robust automation pipeline through RPA applications like process mining.

    <h2>Edge Computing </h2>

    <p class="">    Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data.
Edge computing is a topology- and location-sensitive form of distributed computing, while IoT is a use case instantiation of edge computing."
The origins of edge computing lie in content distributed networks that were created in the late 1990s to serve web and video content from edge servers that were deployed close to users.
[4] In the early 2000s, these networks evolved to host applications and application components at the edge servers, [5] resulting in the first commercial edge computing services [6] that hosted applications such as dealer locators, shopping carts, real-time data aggregators, and ad insertion engines.
The edge computing infrastructure One definition of edge computing is any type of computer program that delivers low latency nearer to the requests .
Karim Arabi, in an IEEE DAC 2014 Keynote [7] and subsequently in an invited talk at MIT's MTL Seminar in 2015, [8] defined edge computing broadly as all computing outside the cloud happening at the edge of the network, and more specifically in applications where real-time processing of data is required.
In his definition, cloud computing operates on big data while edge computing operates on "instant data" that is real-time data generated by sensors or users.
[14] The increase of IoT devices at the edge of the network is producing a massive amount of data - storing and using all that data in cloud data centers pushes network bandwidth requirements to the limit.
In a similar way, the aim of edge computing is to move the computation away from data centers towards the edge of the network, exploiting smart objects , mobile phones , or network gateways to perform tasks and provide services on behalf of the cloud.
Some applications rely on short response times, making edge computing a significantly more feasible option than cloud computing.

  <h2>Quantum Computing </h2>
  <p class=""> Proteins are long strings of amino acids that become useful biological machines when they fold into complex shapes.
A classical supercomputer might try to fold a protein with brute force, leveraging its many processors to check every possible way of bending the chemical chain before arriving at an answer.
In the case of a protein folding problem, that pattern might be the combination of folds requiring the least energy to produce.
In the case of proteins, there are already early quantum algorithms that can find folding patterns in entirely new, more efficient ways, without the laborious checking procedures of classical computers.
As quantum hardware scales and these algorithms advance, they could tackle protein folding problems too complex for any supercomputer.

  <h2>Internet of Things (IoT) </h2>
  <p class=""> The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.
The emergence of these allied technologies continues to push the boundaries of IoT and the data produced by IoT also feeds these technologies.
Industrial IoT (IIoT) refers to the application of IoT technology in industrial settings, especially with respect to instrumentation and control of sensors and devices that engage cloud technologies.
Deriving data-driven insights from IoT data to help better manage the business Increasing productivity and efficiency of business operations Creating new business models and revenue streams Easily and seamlessly connecting the physical business world to the digital world to drive quick time to value
IoT Intelligent Applications are prebuilt software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications that can analyze and present captured IoT sensor data to business users via dashboards.
IoT applications use machine learning algorithms to analyze massive amounts of connected sensor data in the cloud.
With cloud-based IoT applications, business users can quickly enhance existing processes for supply chains, customer service, human resources, and financial services.
An example of this is the use of IoT devices for connected assets to monitor the health of remote machines and trigger service calls for preventive maintenance.
When a hospital’s wheelchairs are equipped with IoT sensors, they can be tracked from the IoT asset-monitoring application so that anyone looking for one can quickly find the nearest available wheelchair.
With IoT, car owners can operate their cars remotely—by, for example, preheating the car before the driver gets in it or by remotely summoning a car by phone.

  <h2>Cyber Security </h2>
  <p class=""> Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks.
It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security.
· Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
Some of these sectors are more appealing to cybercriminals because they collect financial and medical data, but all businesses that use networks can be targeted for customer data, corporate espionage, or customer attacks.
The importance of system monitoring is echoed in the “ 10 steps to cyber security ”, guidance provided by the U.K. government’s National Cyber Security Centre.
In Australia, The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) regularly publishes guidance on how organizations can counter the latest cyber-security threats.
One of the most common cyber threats, malware is software that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage a legitimate user’s computer.
End-user protection or endpoint security is a crucial aspect of cyber security.
Security programs can even detect and remove malicious code hidden in Master Boot Record (MBR) and are designed to encrypt or wipe data from computer’s hard drive.
Use anti-virus software: Security solutions like Kaspersky Total Security will detect and removes threats.
